/**
 * Elastic Container Service (ecs)
 * This component is required to create the Fargate ECS components. It will create a Fargate cluster
 * based on the application name and environment. It will create a "Task Definition", which is required
 * to run a Docker container, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html.
 * It also creates a role with the correct permissions. And lastly, ensures that logs are captured in CloudWatch.
 *
 * When building for the first time, it will install the "hello-world" () image. 
 * The Fargate CLI can be used to deploy new application image on top of this infrastructure.
